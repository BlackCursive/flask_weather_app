# We are going to run this app in a virtual environment.  The virtual environment that I use is pipenv because under
# the hood it is PIP a python package manager and VIRTUALENV a tools that creates isolated Python environments.
# In order to install pipenv we are going to open up a terminal and run
#  *BULLET* - pip install pipenv
# or if you have Homebrew you can run
# *BULLET* - brew install pipenv
# When you are done installing create the directory - weather_app and cd into it then run
# * BULLET * - pipenv shell - in order to create a virtual environment

# Flask is a micro web framework which is lightweight and simple to get up and running
# as opposed to something like Django which is a full-stack web framework.  Although Flask
# can be used for large full fledged products it excels at small single page applications.

# Import Flask Class
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, url_for
# Import OS library
import os
# Import requests HTTP library
import requests

# Retreive API Key from an environment variable - You can simply leave your API Key in the file
# while your developing or testing but before you share your code you may want to hide it.

        # of bracket notation.  This can be a String or a variable. This method return
        # the value for key and if the key is not in the dictionary then it return None
        # which is great because this method never raises a KeyError.
